# Seizure Prediction from EEG Timeseries Data with a Bidirectional LSTM Model

The "main" branch consists of the following three files:
  - seizure_prediction_from_eeg_data_with_bilstm.py
    - Python code that reads the data from a csv file, builds and trains a BiLSTM and a CNN deep learning model to rpedict epileptic seizures from EEG timeseries data, and analyzes the prediction accuracies.
  - Epileptic_Seizure_Recognition.csv
    - Epileptic Seizure Recognition Data Set from the publicly available on the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
  - Seizure Prediction from EEG Data with BiLSTM.pdf
    - Final report detailing the data processing methods, model architectures and accuracy results.
